If I couldn't wake up for this earthquake... How the fuck am I supposed to wake up for school....
Problem with California - always reacting to natural disasters as opposed to being prepared re earthquakes & droughts.
Last night I felt a small shake at around 3:22am but thought I was dreaming. Hope everyone's ok :) #earthquake
After that earthquake I'm just waiting for California to split away from the mainland ?
so um there was a pretty big earthquake like an hour away at 3AM
Update: the earthquake was a 6.1 near the bay area and it caused multiple aftershocks across California
so did socal get the aftershock of that earthquake yet or nah
The most powerful earthquake in decades hammers California.
