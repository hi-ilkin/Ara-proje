If I couldn't wake up for this earthquake... How the fuck am I supposed to wake up for school....
Problem with California - always reacting to natural disasters as opposed to being prepared re earthquakes & droughts.
Last night I felt a small shake at around 3:22am but thought I was dreaming. Hope everyone's ok :) #earthquake
After that earthquake I'm just waiting for California to split away from the mainland ?
so um there was a pretty big earthquake like an hour away at 3AM
Update: the earthquake was a 6.1 near the bay area and it caused multiple aftershocks across California
so did socal get the aftershock of that earthquake yet or nah
